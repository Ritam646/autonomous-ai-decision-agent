## 🎯 What This Project Does

Given a high-level decision goal like:

- *FastAPI vs Django for ML APIs*
- *AWS vs GCP for students*
- *Best ML model for imbalanced datasets*

The agent autonomously:

1. Breaks the goal into sub-tasks (planning)
2. Uses tools to research the web
3. Collects and filters evidence
4. Reasons over observations
5. Produces a justified final decision
6. Exposes an explainable reasoning trace
